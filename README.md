# WCE Vision Transformers

Implemetation of [Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) Paper for the classificaton task of the trails generated by a Wireless Capsule Endoscope.

I am using publicly available [KID datasets](https://mdss.uth.gr/datasets/endoscopy/kid/) for training and testing purpose.  

KID1 dataset consists of nine abnormalities: Angioectasias, Aphthae, Bleeding, ChylousCysts, Lymphangectasias, Polypoids, Stenoses, Ulcers, and Villous Oedemas. 

KID2 dataset contains four abnormalities: Ampulla of Vater, Inflammatory, Polypoids, and Vascular.
